# TypeRush

A modern, professional typing speed test built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. Challenge yourself with our advanced typing test that measures your Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-time Speed Tracking**: Live WPM meter that updates as you type
- **Accuracy Measurement**: Detailed accuracy statistics and error tracking
- **Multiple Test Durations**: Choose from 30, 60, or 90 second tests
- **No Backspace Policy**: Once typed, characters are final - no corrections allowed
- **Smart Word Completion**: Press space to skip incomplete words (they count as errors)
- **Performance Graph**: Visual representation of your typing speed over time
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional Design**: Modern glassmorphism UI with smooth animations

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Chart.js** - Data visualization for performance graphs
- **React Icons** - Icon library

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typerush.git
   cd typerush
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to Use

1. **Start Typing**: The timer begins when you type your first character
2. **Complete Words**: Type words and press space to move to the next word
3. **Skip Words**: Press space in the middle of a word to skip it (counts as an error)
4. **No Corrections**: Once typed, you cannot go back and fix mistakes
5. **View Results**: After the timer ends, see your WPM, accuracy, and performance graph

## Game Rules

- **Timer starts** only when you begin typing actual characters
- **Space bar** moves you to the next word or skips incomplete words
- **No backspace** - characters are final once typed
- **Incomplete words** pressed with space are marked as errors
- **Tab key** restarts the test at any time

## Performance Metrics

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Calculated using (characters/5)/time formula
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Performance Rating**: Elite, Advanced, Intermediate, Beginner, or Novice
- **Detailed Stats**: Correct, incorrect, extra, and missed characters
